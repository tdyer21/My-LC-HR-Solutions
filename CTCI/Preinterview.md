   ## Before an Interview
> "Few things are as impressive to an interviewer as a candidate who built something just for fun."

### Writing a good resume
- Adding less relevant stuff just distracts from the impressive parts of a resume.
- All that matters and all that you have to prove is that you're smart, and you can code.

#### Add a projects section to my actual resume **flag**
- Include 2 - 4 most significant projects. State what the project was and what technologies and languages it employed. Whether or not the project was individual. Independant projects > course projects as they show more initiative.

#### What languages should you list?
- Anything on your resume is considered fair game - caveat is whether or not you list your skill set with the given language. 
  

### Track Misztakes
- Keep a log of the questions you tend to miss when trying practice questions so you know what to go back to later on.
