# Technical Questions

- Technical questions form the basis for how many companies interview. They can be intimidating, there are logic ways around them

## How to prepare: 
For each problem in CTCI do the following:
- Try to solve the problem on your own (hints in the back of the book) thinking about space and time efficiency
- Write code on paper
- Test code on paper (run through error cases)
- Type paper code into an interpreter


### Need to know: Data structures, Algorithms, Concepts
- **Data Structures**: Linked lists, Trees/tries/graphs, Stacks & Queues, Heaps, Vectors/Arraylists, **Hash tables**
- **Algorithms**: Breadth first search, Depth first search, Binary search, Merge sort, Quick sort.
- **Concepts**: Bit manipulation, memory (stack vs. heap), recursion, dynamic programming, Big O time and space. 


## Walking through a problem
1. **Listen** - any and all information in the problem description is likely relavant for an optimal algorithm
2. **Example** - Debug the given example
3. **Brute Force** - Come up with a brute force solution, state it and its runtime and move from there. 
4. **Optimize** - BUD Optimization (look for unused info, reverse engineer thought process, solve it incorrectly, time/space tradeoff)
5. **Walk through** - Walk through the approach in detail, understanding each detail before you code. 
6. **Implement** - Write **Beautiful** code, modularize code from the beginning and refactor to clean up.
7. **Test** - Concept test (walk through) - Unusual or non standard code - hot spots - small test cases - special cases and edge cases

**Bud Optimization** = Bottlenecks, Unnecessary work, Duplicated work


#### Step 1 - Listen
- Note any unique or obscure information. If it is specified that an array is sorted, that is likely important for achieving optimal runtime. 

#### Step 2 - Draw an example
- Immediately draw, use real examples and non-balanced trees, and large examples.
