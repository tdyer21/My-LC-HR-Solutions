- Use single asterisk or underscore to make text italicized

for(let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    console.log('Testing embedded code');
}

## The Interview Process
- The majority of the interview process is likely algorithm/coding
- Verbalize your thought process when tackling problems
- Will generally be assessed on the following:
1. __Analytical skills__: did you need help, how optimal was the solution, etc
2. __Coding skills__: able to successfully translate your algorithm to reasonable code?
3. __Technical knowledge__: Do you have a strong foundation in cs/related tech?
4. __Experience__: Have you made good technical decisions in the past, or built challenging projects?
5. __Culture fit/communication skills__: Do your personality and values fit with the company?

#### Where do the Questions come from?
- Generally interviewers select their own questions
- There is not such thing as a 'Google' interview question, its all contingent on the interviewer
- It's all relative, dont panic if you get a hard question, everyone else thinks its hard aswell.

#### Interview Structure
- Generally 2-3 Phone screenings, and 3-6 on site interviews. 
- Always ask if phone screening interviews will include technical questions
  

### Important Questions to prep:
- _Why do you want to work at x company?_: Prove that you're passionate about the companyn  
   
   
   
   
## Before an Interview
> "Few things are as impressive to an interviewer as a candidate who built something just for fun."

### Writing a good resume
- Adding less relevant stuff just distracts from the impressive parts of a resume.
- All that matters and all that you have to prove is that you're smart, and you can code.

#### Add a projects section to my actual resume **flag**
- Include 2 - 4 most significant projects. State what the project was and what technologies and languages it employed. Whether or not the project was individual. Independant projects > course projects as they show more initiative.

#### What languages should you list?
- Anything on your resume is considered fair game - caveat is whether or not you list your skill set with the given language. 
  

### Track Mistakes
- Keep a log of the questions you tend to miss when trying practice questions so you know what to go back to later on.
