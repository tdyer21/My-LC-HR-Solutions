### The Interview Process
- The majority of the interview process is likely algorithm/coding
- Verbalize your thought process when tackling problems
- Will generally be assessed on the following:
1. __Analytical skills__: did you need help, how optimal was the solution, etc
2. __Coding skills__: able to successfully translate your algorithm to reasonable code?
3. __Technical knowledge__: Do you have a strong foundation in cs/related tech?
4. __Experience__: Have you made good technical decisions in the past, or built challenging projects?
5. __Culture fit/communication skills__: Do your personality and values fit with the company?

#### Where do the Questions come from?
- Generally interviewers select their own questions
- There is not such thing as a 'Google' interview question, its all contingent on the interviewer
- It's all relative, dont panic if you get a hard question, everyone else thinks its hard aswell.

#### Interview Structure
- Generally 2-3 Phone screenings, and 3-6 on site interviews. 
- Always ask if phone screening interviews will include technical questions

### Important Questions to prep:
- Why do you want to work at x company?
