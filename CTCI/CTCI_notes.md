### The Interview Process
- The majority of the interview process is likely algorithm/coding
- Verbalize your thought process when tackling problems
- Will generally be assessed on the following:
1. Analytical skills: did you need help, how optimal was the solution, etc
2. Coding skills: able to successfully translate your algorithm to reasonable code?
3. Technical knowledge: Do you have a strong foundation in cs/related tech?
4. Experience: Have you made good technical decisions in the past, or built challenging projects?
5. Culture fit/communication skills: Do your personality and values fit with the company?
