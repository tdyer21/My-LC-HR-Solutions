Make an interview Prep Grid.(page 32)
- Have a story prepped for "Tell me about yourself"
(I have experiences all across the map with different frameworks and languages, and pride myself in my ability to learn quickly.) Additionally, tie your answer into why you should be considered for the role and casually drop in some self plugs like things you accomplished. (because of my ability to adapt quickly I feel like I would thrive in this small team environment).

### General tips
- When asked your greatest weakness: actually give one, otherwise you sound arrogant.
- When describing your technical projects, focus your individual contributions instead of going on at length about the group, use I instead of we.

### Structuring an answer
"Tell me about a time you had to persuade a group of people to make a big change. 
- first provide a nugget, or interesting piece of information "Sure, let me explain how I convinced my school to let undergrads teach courses."

#### Know your technical projects
- Deeply understand what you're going to say about each technical project you've worked on, why you had a large part in the project's success and what components were difficult.

#### Questions to ask
- **Genuine Questions**: What is the interaction like between teams here? What brought you to this company?
- **Insightful Questions**: Why does your software do X instead of Y?
- **Passion Questions**: Will I have the ability to be a part of other teams and learn skills outside my job description?
